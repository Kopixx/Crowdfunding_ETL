For the SQL file, there is an alteration that needs to be made that is dependent on the file location.
For each COPY query, the FROM field needs to be replaced with the device-specific absolute path to the Resources folder and relevant .csv file.
If the permission is denied for performing this COPY query, please follow the guidelines here to allow folder 'Read' permissions: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc754344(v=ws.11)?redirectedfrom=MSDN

For the Jupyter Notebook file, under the header 'Campaign DataFrame' and the subheading 'Extract the contacts.xlsx Data', using 'header=2' results in 'contact_info' filling the value for the row of index 0. Although the following code can be altered to effectively execute using the 'header=2' command, the result obtained by the above code when using 'header=2' does not match the expected result provided by the starter code. Using 'header=3' produces the expected result, further supporting the idea that this might be a typo / error.
